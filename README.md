# UFOs
UFOs project module for University of Toronto

## Overview of Project: 

A web page is created to provide a more detailed analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, weâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: 

As soon as a user accesses the page S/he sees the home page with a small article and a filter criteria with multiple filters.

The user can search using one or multiple field entries. Based on that the display results will change. Say, for example, if I search with Date as "1/13/2010" and hit enter, it will display the results across the US.

If the user uses multiple search boxes, it will display the data accordingly. For example, the user searches the Date as "1/4/2010", Country as "us" and State as "ca" and then hit enter, S/he will see different set of results as shown below

## Summary:
### Drawback: 
One drawback that I see straight from this page is that the data is static and it is never updated. 
### Two Recommendations: 
The two recommendations that I can think of:

1. Add a live data source which is regularly updated

2. Make the search ignore upper or lower cases
